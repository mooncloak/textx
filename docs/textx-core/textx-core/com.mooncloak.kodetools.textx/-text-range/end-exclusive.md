# endExclusive

[common]\
open override val [~~endExclusive~~](end-exclusive.md): [Int](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin/-int/index.html)

---

### Deprecated

Can throw an exception when it's impossible to represent the value with Int type, for example, when the range includes MAX_VALUE. It's recommended to use 'endInclusive' property that doesn't throw.
