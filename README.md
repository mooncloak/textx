# textx

kotlinx.serialization models for representing rich text content. This makes it easier for different platforms, in
particular mobile platforms, to render rich text using their native UI framework without complex format-specific
parsers. For instance, instead of the server providing an HTML text string through an API, requiring the client to use
a WebView component to render it, the server can return these pre-parsed serialization models, which can easily be
transformed into native UI components for each platform.
